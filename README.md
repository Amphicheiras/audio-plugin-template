## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JUCE Framework: Required for building and running the plugin. Download from JUCE.
- Supported DAWs: Any Digital Audio Workstation that supports VST, AU, or standalone plugins.
- Compiler: Ensure a compatible C++ compiler is installed. For Windows, MSVC is recommended, while Xcode works well on macOS.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/Amphicheiras/UF-Oscilloscope.git
     cd UF-Oscilloscope
    ```

2. Have a look at the /root and /plugin CMakeLists.txt

2. Configure with CMake:
   ```sh
   cmake -S . -B build
   ```

3. Compile with CMake:
   ```sh
   cmake --build build
   ```
